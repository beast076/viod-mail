# What is this?
This disposable mailbox keeps your main mailbox clean from spam.

# How does it work?
You select the address you want to use and received emails will be displayed automatically. 

Just choose an address and use it on websites you don't trust and don't want to use your main email address. Once you are done, you can just forget about the mailbox. All the spam stays here and does not fill up your main mailbox.

# Is this safe?
There is no registration and no passwords. If you know the address, you can read the emails. Basically, all emails are public. So don't use it for sensitive data.

# Are emails deleted?
Emails will be deleted after 30 days.
